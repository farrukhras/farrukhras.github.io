For this purpose, we present SafarNama: a mobile Augmented Reality application with a novel approach to learning history and culture for Pakistan through gamified virtual trips using historically relevant 3D exhibits and an event-based dialogue system. The application aims to promote story-based, interactive and spatial learning as well as parental and teacher involvement and physical activity for children as they engage on virtual tours.",
